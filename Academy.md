## Server Goal: Gym Leader (Enfin c'est qu'une idée ...)

Each player must build their own gym, with a maximum of **2 types**. Once everyone has progressed enough, a **Gym Leader Championship** event will be organized.

### Event Rules

- Each gym will be **judged on its aesthetics**.
- **Battles** will take place between players.
- Each player must prepare **2 teams**:
  1. **Gym Team**: a team matching your gym's type theme.
  2. **Challenger Team**: a **fixed** team used to challenge other players' gyms and earn their badges.

### Spawn Monument

A monument at spawn displays which player is the Gym Leader for which type. Ask an **OP** to update your types.

## Legendary Items

### How to Obtain Them

Legendary items are found in **world chests**. Drop chance is based on **distance from spawn**:

| Distance from Spawn | Legendary Item Chance |
|----------------------|------------------------|
| Spawn (t0) | None |
| 1,000 blocks and beyond (t1-t9) | **1/50 per chest** |

> On average, about **50 chests** (roughly 3-4 villages) to find one legendary item.

### Gym Loot

Each Rad Gym victory gives a **1/20** chance of a legendary item, regardless of distance from spawn. Gyms also have a **1/15** chance of dropping a **TM/CT**.

### Chest Loot (t1-t9)

All chests from tier 1 onwards contain the same variety of items, in addition to tier-specific rewards (money, candy, medicine, etc.):

| Item | Drop Rate | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------|
| Poke Balls (basic) | **1/3** | Poke Ball, Premier, Verdant, Azure, etc. |
| Great Balls | **1/5** | Great Ball, Heal, Nest, Net, Luxury, etc. |
| Ultra Balls | **1/10** | Ultra Ball, Dusk, Repeat, Timer, Quick, etc. |
| Master-tier Balls | **1/50** | Safari, Sport, Dream, Beast, Park, Master Ball |
| Fossils | **1/30** | Regular fossils (90%) + Shiny/HA/MaxIV fossils (10%) |
| Fossils (underground) | **1/15** | Same pool, double rate in underground chests |
| Gym Keys | **1/30** | All 18 type keys |
| TMs/CTs | **1/15** | Random TM |
| Pokeblocks | **1/30** | Common > Uncommon > Rare > Epic > Legendary |
| Shiny Pokeblock | **1/1024** | Rare shiny pokeblock |

| Rotom Forms | **1/50** | Random Rotom Form item |
| Arceus Plates | **1/50** | Random Arceus Plate |
| Booster Packs | **1/20** | Card booster pack |

### Unique Items

Each legendary item is **unique per server**. Once a player obtains an item, no one else can find it. This encourages trading between players.

### How It Works

1. You find a legendary item in a chest.
2. You receive a placeholder item that transforms into a random legendary item, filtered by the **biome** you're in.
3. The item is consumed when used to summon the corresponding legendary Pokemon.
4. A **server-wide broadcast** announces the spawn to all players.

### Biome-Based Categories

Legendary items are split into **15 thematic categories** tied to biomes:

| Biome | Available Categories |
|-------|----------------------|
| Deserts / Badlands / Nether | Fire, Ruin, Rock, Steel |
| Oceans / Rivers / Beaches | Water |
